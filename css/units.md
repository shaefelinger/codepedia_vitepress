## Absolute Units

| Unit | Description        |
| ---- |:------------------ |
| px   | pixels             |
| pt   | points             |
| pc   | picas (apc = 12 pt |
| cm   | centimeters        |
| mm   | milimeters         |
| in   | inches             |

- In web development, you usually use **px for height and width**, and **pt for font-size**.

- Pixel values (px) actual size on the screen depends on the screen of the device. It is good practice to test your website on multiple devices.
- `0` is the same for all units 

## Relative Units

| Unit | Description                                                  |
| ---- |:------------------------------------------------------------ |
| em   | Relative to the elementâ€™s font size (2em = 2 times the font size) |
| rem  | Relative to the font size of the root element - **most used!** |
| vw   | Relative to 1% of the viewport width                         |
| vh   | Relative to 1% of the height of the viewport                 |
| %    | Relative to the parent element                               |

- It is good practice to use **em** and **rem** a lot. It helps create good responsive websites. 
- **vw** is also a useful unit, but has to be tested especially on small devices.
