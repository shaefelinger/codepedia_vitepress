# Velocity.js

 Vue’s JavaScript Hooks and combine that with a helpful animation library called [Velocity.js](http://velocityjs.org/) to build out some more powerful animations.

## JavaScript Hooks

 are similar to Vue’s [lifecycle hooks](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/instance.html#Instance-Lifecycle-Hooks) (`beforeCreate`, `created`, etc), but are specific to Vue’s `transition` and `transition-group` components. You can think of them as the stages of the lifetime of a Vue transition.

Below is a list of them

- `before-enter`
- `enter`
- `after-enter`
- `before-leave`
- `enter-cancelled`
- `leave`
- `after-leave`
- `leave-cancelled`

[//]: # (<img src="./assets/js-hooks.png" />)



When they are called, we can have them trigger methods, 

```js
    <transition
      @before-enter="beforeEnter"
      @enter="enter"
      @after-enter="afterEnter"
      @enter-cancelled="enterCancelled"
    
      @before-leave="beforeLeave"
      @leave="leave"
      @after-leave="afterLeave"
      @leave-cancelled="leaveCancelled"
    >
      <!-- ... -->
    </transition>
```

> common practice: name the methods the same as the js-hook

```js
   <template>
    	<div>
    	  <button @click="isOpen = !isOpen">
    	    My Profile
    	  </button>
      
        <transition
          @before-enter="beforeEnter"
          @enter="enter"
          @leave="leave"
          :css="false"
        >
          <div v-if="isOpen" class="drawer">
            <img src="../assets/avatar.png" alt="avatar" />
            <div></div>
            <div></div>
            <div></div>
            <div></div>
          </div>
        </transition>
      </div>
    </template>
```

**Note:** We’re using `:css="false"` to tell Vue it doesn’t need to worry about handling the transition classes here since we’re relying on the JavaScript hooks instead.

- `beforeEnter()`, we want that method to set the initial style of the drawer *before* it enters the interface.
- `enter()` method to set the styles we want the drawer to end up with when it enters.
- `leave()` method will set the styles we want the drawer to transition to when it leaves our interface.

```js
methods: {
        beforeEnter(el) {
          // we'll place our starting style here
        },
        enter(el, done) {
    			// style to transition to on enter
        },
        leave(el, done) {
    	   // style to transition away to on leave
        }
```

 each have the `el` parameter. This will give our methods access to the element that is being transitioned,

## Velocity

https://www.npmjs.com/package/velocity-animate

http://velocityjs.org/

 `npm i velocity-animate` 

```js
import Velocity from 'velocity-animate'
...
 methods: {
    beforeEnter(el) {
      el.style.opacity = 0
      el.style.width = '0em'
    },
    enter(el, done) {
      Velocity(
        el,
        { opacity: 1, width: '12em' },
        { duration: 1000, easing: 'easeOutCubic', complete: done }
      )
    }
  }
```

### Starting Style

```js
   beforeEnter(el) {
      el.style.opacity = 0
      el.style.width = '0em'
    },
```

### Enter Style

```js
    enter(el, done) {
      Velocity(
        el, // element to animate
        { opacity: 1, width: '12em' }, // new style rules
        { duration: 1000, easing: 'easeOutCubic', complete: done } // define how transition happens and complete it
      )
    }
```

We’ve passed in a few arguments to the `Velocity()` method, first handing it the element to animate (`el`) and then giving it an object with the new style rules we want applied to that element.  Finally, we’re passing in some rules to define our transition’s `duration`, its `easing` function, and then we’ve handed it `done`, which is a method that will be run when the velocity animation is complete. This lets Vue know this hook has completed, and it can move on to the next one in its lifecycle.

### Leave Style

```js
    leave(el, done) {
      Velocity(
        el,
        { opacity: 0, width: '0em' },
        { duration: 500, easing: 'easeInCubic', complete: done }
      )
    }
```

### The Power of Velocity 

Velocity has more features 

eg. spring physics which allows us to create **springy/snappy/bouncy** motion in our interfaces.

```js
  enter(el, done) {
      Velocity(
        el,
        { opacity: 1, width: '12em' }, 
        { duration: 1000, easing: [60, 10], complete: done } // now with spring physics
      )
    }
```

the first (`60`) is the amount of **tension** and the second (`10`) is the amount of **friction**
